# Enumerating the positive zeros of a real function

Many special functions have their positive zeros separated by an explicit sequence
`0 = t₀ < t₁ < t₂ < ⋯ → ∞`: exactly one zero lies in each open interval `(tₙ, tₙ₊₁)` and none at the
separating points. This file turns such a separation into the standard enumeration of the zeros
by `k ↦ (the zero with exactly k smaller positive zeros)`, which is how zero sequences such as
the zeros of the cosine and sine integrals (DLMF §6.13) are specified.

## Main results

* `zcount_existsUnique_zero`: a continuous strictly increasing function changing sign on `[a, b]`
  has exactly one zero in `(a, b)`.
* `zcount_enum`: from a separating sequence to the enumeration by number of smaller zeros.

/-- **Enumeration of separated zeros.** If `0 = t₀ < t₁ < ⋯` is unbounded, `P` holds at exactly
one point of each `(tₙ, tₙ₊₁)` and at none of the `tₙ₊₁`, then the `k`-th positive point of `P`
(the one with exactly `k` smaller positive points) is well defined, lies in `(t_k, t_{k+1})`, and
these points are strictly increasing and exhaust the positive points of `P`. -/
